# Collecting Metrics for TCP Services

ref : [https://istio.io/v1.6/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/tcp-metrics/](https://istio.io/v1.6/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/tcp-metrics/)



This task shows how to configure Istio to automatically gather telemetry for TCP services in a mesh. At the end of this task, you can query default TCP metrics for your mesh.

The [Bookinfo](https://istio.io/v1.6/docs/examples/bookinfo/) sample application is used as the example throughout this task.
